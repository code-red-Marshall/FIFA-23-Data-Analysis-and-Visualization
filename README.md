## Analysis
Distribution of Player Ratings:
The analysis shows that the majority of players have ratings between 60 and 80. This indicates that the player ratings are normally distributed, with a few players having exceptionally high or low ratings.

## Comparison of Top Players by Position:
This visualization helps in identifying the top players in each position. For instance, we can see that forwards generally have higher ratings compared to defenders and goalkeepers. This insight is useful for understanding the distribution of talent across different positions.

## Nationality-wise Distribution of Players:
This analysis provides an overview of the countries that produce the most players in FIFA 23. It can be observed that certain countries have a higher representation, which could be due to the popularity of football in those regions.

## Age vs. Overall Rating Scatter Plot:
The scatter plot highlights the relationship between a player's age and their overall rating. It is evident that younger players generally have lower ratings, while players in their prime years (mid-20s to early 30s) tend to have higher ratings. This reflects the career progression of professional footballers.
